## [0.2.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.2.4...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.5) — 2026-09-06


### Added

- **persona**: The holder's own identity, and a boundary a context cannot read across ([#1255](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1255))

* feat(persona): register the persona keyspace

  Fourth holder store, beside the vault, agent memory and application state.
  It is distinct because disclosure control is its point, and app-state
  promises never to interpret its records — so it cannot host something whose
  whole job is deciding which members may leave.

  Two scopes share the keyspace and the split is a control, not filing: the
  pool and profiles are agent-scoped so the correlation index can see the same
  value presented by two personas in two contexts, which a per-context index
  cannot see by construction.

  BACKED_UP, because a restore without the holder's identity returns an agent
  that no longer knows who its holder is.

  Cascade on DID deletion, with the nuance the per-keyspace enum cannot
  express: only the context-scoped half is DID-keyed. Bindings and contacts
  cascade; the pool survives, because a profile may be bound to several
  personas and deleting one must not destroy facts presented through another.

  * feat(persona): vta-persona crate — models, key layout, correlation index

  The fourth holder store. Distinct from app-state because disclosure control
  is its point, and a store that promises never to interpret its records cannot
  gate what leaves them.

  model.rs carries the shapes the specs made normative. Two choices are
  load-bearing. ProofRung derives Ord so that 'the highest rung this format
  supports' is a max() rather than a hand-written table that can disagree with
  itself. And ProfileEntry::referenced() returns None only for inline entries,
  which is what makes a context-local profile checkable: one is valid exactly
  when no entry references the pool.

  storage.rs builds every key in one place, because the agent-scoped and
  context-scoped prefixes are a security boundary and a call site that formats
  its own key can put a record on the wrong side of it. scope_of() returns
  Option rather than defaulting — a key nobody recognises must not be assumed
  safe to serve a context-scoped caller. Local profiles get their own prefix
  rather than a flag, so a context-scoped scan reaches a space that
  structurally cannot hold a pool profile; a filter is a line of code that can
  be got wrong, an address space cannot.

  correlation.rs is keyed by HMAC over a canonicalised value, so exact-match
  lookup works with no plaintext index over the holder's PII — and prefix and
  substring search are out of scope by construction, which is the trade.
  Canonicalisation sorts object members, or two serialisations of one fact
  would hash differently and the guard would miss the reuse it exists to catch.
  Comparison is constant-time, or an attacker submitting candidates could use
  timing to learn what the holder holds.

  severity() encodes the inversion that is easy to get backwards: a credential
  presented WHOLE correlates more than a self-asserted value, because the
  issuer signature is identical at every verifier, while a derived proof
  correlates less because it differs every presentation. Scoring on provenance
  alone would rank an attested claim safer than a typed one and push holders
  toward the riskier option.

  * feat(persona): pin trust-tasks-rs 0.17.9 and assert the contract in tests

  The persona family is published, so the generated payload types are now the
  contract this crate stores against. Taken as a dev-dependency rather than a
  real one: storage needs none of it, and depending on it only in tests means a
  spec change that lands upstream without a matching change here fails a test
  instead of a production dispatch.

  Two assertions earn their place. The proof and issuedAt constants are how a
  dispatcher learns those were declared REQUIRED, so a relaxation upstream
  surfaces as a failing test rather than as an accepted unsigned write. And our
  ValueType is compared to the published enum on the wire, because a variant
  added upstream without a matching arm here would silently reject a value the
  spec calls legal.

  * feat(persona): attribute store — versions, preconditions, tombstones, indexes

  Read-modify-write is serialised by a process-local lock rather than a CAS,
  following the conclusion app-state reached: there is no reachable multi-writer
  topology, and a CAS would be atomic exactly where the lock already suffices
  while staying non-atomic on the vsock proxy that would need it.

  The version counter is reserved BEFORE the write it belongs to. A crash
  between reserving and writing leaks a number, which is harmless because
  versions are opaque and monotonic and never an edit count. The opposite order
  would reuse one, which is not.

  Index maintenance runs before the record write, deliberately. A crash then
  leaves an index entry with no record — a false positive in the correlation
  guard — rather than a record with no index entry, which would read as a false
  ALL-CLEAR. Over-warning is recoverable; under-warning is the failure the
  guard exists to prevent.

  A tombstone is not a live record, so expectedVersion 0 succeeds over one and
  the new record takes a later counter value. A repeat delete returns
  existed: false and takes NO version: had it taken one, every consumer
  watching the store would see a change that did not happen and delete could
  not be safely retried — asserted by a test that measures the counter either
  side.

  correlation_count returns a count and never identifiers, because returning
  them on a write would disclose the holder's other compositions to whatever
  tool made it.

  * feat(persona): profiles, resolution, and the reverse index

  put_profile validates every reference before taking a version, so a refused
  write consumes nothing, and refuses the whole composition on a dangling
  reference — a partially-resolved profile would disclose less than the holder
  composed and tell them nothing about it.

  The reverse index drops its old edges before adding new ones. Without that an
  attribute removed from a profile keeps a stale referrer, and its delete is
  refused for a reference that no longer exists.

  An override replaces value and label only; provenance is inherited. A pin
  naming a version the store no longer holds resolves stale with no value
  rather than silently serving the current one, which would defeat the entire
  point of pinning.

  Deleting a profile leaves the pool untouched. A profile references rather
  than owns, so removing a composition destroys no facts — the asymmetry with
  attribute deletion, where removal does change what compositions present.

  **Fixes a real serde defect the tests caught.** ProfileEntry is untagged, and
  untagged tries variants in declaration order while serde ignores unknown
  fields — so the permissive Ref variant was matching {ref, override} and
  {ref, pinVersion}, silently degrading an override into a live reference and a
  pin into an unpinned one. A disclosure changing behind the holder's back.
  deny_unknown_fields is not available on a variant, so the fix is declaration
  order with Ref last, documented at the enum and pinned by a test.

  * feat(persona): bindings — the push across the context boundary

  Setting a binding is the moment a composition crosses from agent scope into a
  context, and the crossing has a direction: the holder pushes a materialised
  projection down, and a context never pulls.

  MaterialisedClaim is a distinct type from ResolvedClaim rather than the same
  one with a field left empty. The difference IS the security property — a
  function handed a MaterialisedClaim cannot obtain a pool identifier, so no
  future edit leaks one across the boundary by forgetting to clear it. The
  compiler enforces what a reviewer would otherwise have to notice. Asserted on
  the serialised bytes, because what crosses the boundary is what was written.

  rematerialise() keeps 'edit once, everywhere' working without opening a read
  path: it is a write initiated ABOVE the boundary, never a pull from below.

  Binding to a missing profile is refused rather than written — a binding that
  appears configured and presents nothing is a failure the holder discovers
  from the other side. Clearing is a first-class state, not an absence: a
  persona with no profile is legitimate and common.

  A second persona on one profile is counted and returned, because that act
  makes them the same person by construction and no later narrowing undoes it.
  A count, not identifiers — the association between the holder's personas is
  exactly what an attacker wants.

  BindingSummary is what a context-scoped caller may learn: whether bound, the
  label, a claim count. It has nowhere to put a value, which is the point.

  * feat(persona): contacts — revisions, diffs, and reference-counted retention

  A contact is what a peer disclosed, appended as a revision and never
  overwritten. An address book that silently replaces a payment address is a
  phishing surface; one that reports what changed and when is a defence — which
  is what changed_claims and has_unreviewed_change exist for. A revision
  history nobody is shown is an archive, not a defence.

  Keyed on (context, subject, knownByPersona): the same peer met through two
  personas is two contacts. Collapsing them would correlate the holder's own
  personas inside their own address book, which is the one place nobody would
  think to look for that linkage.

  The diff counts a claim that VANISHED as changed. A diff reporting only
  mutations stays quiet when a peer stops disclosing their payment address,
  which is exactly when it should speak up.

  A reaped revision returns Gone, never NotFound. A caller comparing a current
  value against history must tell 'never existed' from 'no longer kept' —
  only the second means their comparison is unsound rather than mistaken, and
  collapsing them lets a producer conclude 'nothing changed' from an absence
  that means the opposite.

  Retention counts references rather than days. A revision cited by a
  disclosure record is evidence of what the holder was shown before they
  presented; a flat TTL would delete it precisely when it mattered. Deletion
  reports what it retained, because an incomplete erasure the holder believes
  is complete is worse than one they know about.

  The outgoing revision is archived BEFORE the new one lands, so a crash leaves
  a duplicate rather than a gap — and a gap in a history that exists to prove
  what changed is worse than a repeat.

  * feat(persona): the disclosure record, and the caller retention was built for

  Append-only, and written BEFORE the artifact is returned. A crash between
  signing and recording would release data the holder could never afterwards
  discover they had released; recording first can only produce a record of a
  disclosure that did not happen, which is a false positive they can
  investigate. One of those is recoverable.

  Records name claim TYPES and rungs, never values. Re-storing the values would
  double the exposure the record exists to describe, and put a second plaintext
  copy of the holder's data in a structure whose whole purpose is to be read
  later. The rung is recorded because the same claim type at two rungs is two
  very different disclosures.

  contexts_reached_by() pays the debt the scope split incurred. Putting the
  pool above the context boundary bought a correlation check that sees across
  contexts; the cost is that a holder can no longer tell from one context where
  a fact has gone. This answers it directly.

  record_disclosure cites the contact revisions a disclosure relied on — the
  caller reference-counted retention was built for, and until now had none.
  Citation happens after the record lands: a citation with no record retains a
  revision nobody needs, while a record with no citation would let the evidence
  behind it be reaped. Only one of those loses something.

  * feat(persona): task URIs and retry-safety classification

  Adding the 24 URIs to ALL_URIS made every_uri_is_classified fail until each
  was classified, which is the census working: a task cannot join the catalogue
  without someone deciding what a lost reply costs it.

  Writes are Keyed following the app-state precedent — without a precondition a
  replay writes twice and bumps the counter twice, so a watcher sees a change
  that never happened. Deletes are RetrySafe because they converge: a repeat
  finds a tombstone, returns existed: false, and takes no counter value.

  Two entries are worth reading twice. disclosure/preview looks like a read and
  is Keyed, because it mints the single-use token present consumes — a replayed
  preview hands out a second authorisation to disclose. And disclosure/present
  is Keyed because a replay is a second release of personal data to a third
  party and a second permanent record of it: the one task in this family where
  a lost reply must never be retried blind.

  * feat(persona): the authorization boundary, enforced and pinned by census

  The pool and profiles are agent-scoped; bindings, contacts and disclosure
  records are context-scoped. Nothing inside a context may read the pool. That
  is a rule about direction rather than a permission — an access-control failure
  over a readable pool discloses everything, while a pool no context can address
  has nothing to disclose.

  The gate is require_super_admin (Admin AND unrestricted scope), not a role
  check. A guard written as 'is this caller an administrator' PASSES for an
  administrator scoped to a single context, who would then read and write
  identity data belonging to every other one. vti-common's own act_scope docs
  warn about the same edge from the other side: an empty context list means
  unrestricted for Admin and nothing at all for every other role, so a call site
  testing is_empty() without the role gets one of the two backwards. Both halves
  are asserted.

  REACH classifies all 24 tasks and is exhaustive by test, so a task cannot join
  the family without someone deciding which side it is on — and an unknown URI
  is refused rather than defaulted, because defaulting to Context is exactly how
  a pool read becomes reachable from inside one.

  The test that matters is a_context_scoped_admin_is_refused_every_holder_task:
  it iterates every holder-only task and asserts an admin scoped to ctx-work is
  turned away. That is the conformance witness the design asked for, and the
  test that would have caught the trap.

- **rooms**: A VTA joins a room, keeps up, and opens what it holds ([#1250](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1250))

Implements rooms/keys/{key-package,welcome,commit,open} - the delivery
  flow specified in dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#355 and the decryption oracle from
  #349, on the custody layer from #1248. This is the piece that makes a
  data room readable by an agent that never holds a key.

  Four tasks, four different gates, and only one is a capability. The
  delivery three are inbound - a room's owner reaching this VTA - and an
  ACL of ours has no opinion about who a room's owner is. commit in
  particular is authorized INSIDE the group: MLS authenticates the
  committer as a member of the group we already hold, and a list we kept
  would be this service deciding who may commit to a room it is not part
  of. Only open is our own principal's agent asking us to decrypt, which is
  what a capability is for - RoomOpen, registered upstream in #351.

  The invitation is what makes a Welcome acceptable. A Welcome carries a
  group's secrets, so anyone able to reach a VTA could otherwise push group
  state into it. Joining a room is already a two-party act and the VIC is
  already the consent artefact; this is where that stops being ceremonial.
  Five checks, none optional - it parses as an invitation, its proof
  verifies, the issuer is the room, the subject is us, and it is live and
  unspent - and dropping any one leaves a way in. VerifiedInvitation is
  constructible only by the verifier, so a caller cannot reach consumption
  with something nobody checked.

  The invitation is consumed only AFTER the join succeeds. Burning it on a
  Welcome that then failed to process would strand the member: invitation
  spent, not in the room.

  Joining twice is refused rather than merged. Two group states for one
  room is a condition nothing downstream can resolve - open has no way to
  choose, and choosing wrong returns 'did not open' for a record the member
  can plainly see.

  open reports which epoch the VTA holds when a record is sealed under a
  later one. A member who missed a commit is stuck at their last epoch, and
  the raw symptom is 'this record does not open', which reads like
  corruption; naming the epoch turns it into 'a commit has not been
  delivered', which an operator can act on.

  Two keyspaces, both Cascade on DID deletion: room_groups holds group
  secrets and belongs at the same protection level as the key store, and
  room_invitations outlives the groups it admitted - while the member
  exists, a consumed invitation MUST survive leaving a room, or the same
  invitation would work twice.

  Four censuses had something to say. The MCP guard, where open and welcome
  are Sensitive (plaintext out, key material in) while key-package and
  commit are ordinary mutations. Retry safety, which produced four
  different answers and is the better for it: open is ReadOnly, commit is
  RetrySafe because the spec made replay a no-op precisely so delivery
  could retry, and key-package and welcome are Keyed - one leaves a second
  private half behind, the other cannot tell a lost reply from a completed
  join. Then the conformance witnesses and the namespace list.

  trust-tasks-rs 0.17.8 landed mid-build carrying #351, #354 and #355, so
  all four request types are generated rather than hand-written.



## [0.2.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.2.3...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.4) — 2026-08-29


### Added

- **vta**: Cascade, refuse and revoke when a DID is deleted ([#1198](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1198))

`dids delete` removed the daemon-side DID, the local webvh record and log, and
  the DID's keys. Nothing else. ACL entries, issued credentials, sessions and
  per-DID state were left behind.

  That is the VTC's ACL-revoke orphan (#1194, #1196) one level up: a surface
  owning part of a multi-part identity and knowing nothing about the rest. There
  it produced a live member row with no authorization and credentials that still
  verified for anyone holding them, found in production. The VTA had the same
  shape and had not been asked the question yet.

  Deleting a DID is four relationships, not one, and treating them alike gets one
  wrong in a way nobody notices until it matters:

  - what the DID **owns** goes with it;
  - what **names it as a subject of authorization** must go with it, or it
    becomes authority for an identity that can no longer be resolved or rotated;
  - what **depends on it to function** must stop the deletion, because cascading
    would silently break it;
  - what the VTA **issued** cannot be deleted at all, because third parties hold
    copies — so the only honest action is revocation.

  The fourth is the one most likely to be got wrong, because it looks most like a
  cascade. Deleting our record of an issued credential does not invalidate the
  copies; it destroys the only means of revoking them.

  This implements the three decisions taken on that model. A deletion revokes the
  credentials it cannot destroy. A dependency refuses the deletion and names the
  command that unpicks it, rather than cascading through something still in use.
  There is no `--force` — the same call as `would_violate_last_service`, for the
  same reason.

  Revocation runs first, before any deletion, remote or local. If a later step
  fails the credentials are already dead and the DID still exists, which is
  recoverable by re-running; the other order leaves live credentials for a DID
  nobody can revoke through any more. When a partial failure is possible, the
  state that survives should be the over-restrictive one. The preflight is
  read-only, so a refusal leaves the VTA exactly as it found it.



## [0.2.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.2.2...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.3) — 2026-08-29


## [0.2.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.2.1...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.2) — 2026-08-28


## [0.2.1](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.2.0...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.1) — 2026-08-26


### Added

- **app-state**: A third store for versioned, namespaced application state ([#1051](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1051))

Applications built on a VTA have had nowhere to keep versioned metadata.
  Adds `vta/app-state/{get,put,list,delete,get-many,put-many}/1.0` — a store
  beside the secrets vault and the credential vault, for JSON an application
  owns and the VTA does not interpret.

  Records are addressed `(contextId, namespace, key)`. The namespace scopes one
  application so several tools can share a context without colliding, and is the
  seam a per-namespace grant would later use — which is why it is part of the
  address rather than a prefix convention on the key. In 1.0 a namespace is
  collision avoidance and NOT a trust boundary: an application with write access
  to a context reaches every namespace in it, and the `put` and `delete` specs
  say so normatively. Isolation means separate contexts.

  Deliberately not built on `vta/memory/*`. `MemoryItem` is `{key, value}` with
  nothing to hang a precondition on, and its `list` returns the whole context —
  but the argument that settles it is that "forget everything" has to stay a safe
  thing to ask an agent, which it cannot be if account state lives there.

  Three properties are why this is a store rather than a field on an existing one.

  **One counter per `(contextId, namespace)`, not per record.** A record's
  `version` is the counter value its most recent write took, so one number is
  simultaneously the optimistic-concurrency token `expectedVersion` compares
  against and the watermark `sinceVersion` compares against. A per-record counter
  serves the first but cannot serve the second — two records' counters are not
  comparable, so no single number means "everything after this point" — and would
  have forced a second sequence kept consistent by hand. The cost is that a
  record's version jumps by whatever its neighbours consumed, which the wire
  contract states: versions are opaque and monotonic, never an edit count.

  **A failed precondition returns the current version AND value.** A bare
  rejection obliges a re-read, and the re-read races the next write; the pattern
  has no fixed point under contention. Returning the winner's view removes the
  race rather than narrowing it, and the spec makes it normative.

  **Delete leaves a versioned tombstone, and the tombstones are reaped.** Without
  one, a consumer pulling from a watermark learns of every create and update and
  never of a deletion, so deleted records resurrect on its next rebuild.
  Retention is `app_state.tombstone_retention_days` (default 30, matching the
  vault's `grace_days`) — a destructive window is an operator's choice, not a
  constant — and `list` advertises the configured value, since a consumer
  schedules against that number. The sweeper runs from the storage thread beside
  the ACL/consent/vault sweepers.

  The sweeper reaps a *prefix*, not a set: each namespace walks its tombstones in
  version order and stops at the first still inside the window. Reaping a later
  tombstone while leaving an earlier one would make the reap watermark
  unstateable — no single number would describe what survives, which is precisely
  what `watermarkTooOld` has to be able to say. `0` days disables reaping, and
  that is enforced at the call site rather than as a zero cutoff, which would mean
  the opposite.

  Version reservation is fsynced and re-seals the TEE integrity manifest, for the
  reason `vti_common::store::counter` gives for BIP-32 counters: a counter
  surviving only in the journal buffer can be re-derived after a crash and reissue
  a used value. Here a reused version means two records collide on one `appv:`
  index key, so one disappears from the change feed and every incremental consumer
  misses that change permanently, silently. A batch reserves a block and pays one
  fsync rather than N; writes that then fail leave gaps, which are safe and
  tested.

  Retry safety: reads are `ReadOnly`, `delete` is `RetrySafe` (a second delete
  finds a tombstone and deliberately takes no new version, so a watcher sees
  nothing), and `put`/`put-many` are `Keyed` — a `put` without `expectedVersion`
  does not converge, and the class is per URI, not per payload.

  Blobs are deliberately out of scope in 1.0; adding a `blobRef` is additive.

  Concurrency is a process-local lock per namespace, not a store-layer
  compare-and-swap. fjall takes an exclusive database lock so two processes cannot
  share a store, and the vsock protocol has no atomic opcode — its
  `insert_if_absent`/`swap` are already non-atomic fallbacks. A CAS today would be
  atomic exactly where the lock suffices and a warn-and-fallback exactly where it
  would need to be real. Recorded in the design note with what would change that.

  Schemas published upstream as trustoverip/dtgwg-trust-tasks-tf#252 and #253;
  this depends on the released trust-tasks-rs 0.11.2, pinned to a minimum patch so
  an older resolve fails as a stale dependency rather than as unspecced URIs.
  Conformance witnesses cover all six URIs, so nothing enters
  `UNSPECCED_DISPATCHED_URIS`.



## [0.2.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.1.5...vta-keyspaces-v0.2.0) — 2026-08-20


### Added

- **vta**: Dedup keyed Trust Tasks on an idempotency key ([#1011](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/1011))

A client that retries a timed-out request is doing the right thing. The
  dangerous case is the one where the VTA processed it and only the reply
  was lost, because the retry then produces a second durable effect —
  `webvh/dids/create` being the sharp example, where auto-assigned paths
  mean the retry mints a *different* DID and the first stays published
  with nobody holding a reference to it.

  The existing `trust_tasks::replay` layer cannot catch that. It keys on
  `(actor, envelope-id)` and every SDK path mints a fresh `urn:uuid:` per
  attempt, so a genuine retry sails past it. Its own module docs name this
  work as the deliberate follow-up.

  ## Built on the store that was already here



## [0.1.5](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.1.4...vta-keyspaces-v0.1.5) — 2026-08-18


## [0.1.4](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.1.3...vta-keyspaces-v0.1.4) — 2026-08-17


### Added

- **vta-keys**: Add non-extractable internal signing keys ([#995](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/995))

An ordinary VTA key is BIP-32 derived, so anyone holding the 24-word mnemonic
  can reconstruct it offline. That is what makes the VTA recoverable, and equally
  what makes "the operator cannot obtain this key" false — the second limb of what
  eIDAS calls sole control.

  An internal key is generated from the system CSPRNG, has no derivation path, and
  is never returned by any surface. The VTA acts only as a signing oracle for it.

  Deliberately not a flag on the imported-key path. That path wraps its secrets
  under a KEK derived from the master seed (derive_kek(seed, salt)), so a
  non-extractable flag on it would be decorative: the boundary it claims to
  enforce has already been walked around. Internal keys get their own keyspace,
  INTERNAL_KEYS, with no seed involvement at any point, and that keyspace is in
  EXCLUDED_FROM_BACKUP by design — a backup carrying it would be an export of keys
  the VTA promises never to export, and restoring it elsewhere would clone a
  signer.

  Refused for did:webvh log entries, enforced in code rather than left to
  guidance. WebVH is append-only and each entry is authorised by the update key
  the previous entry named; an unrecoverable update key means that if storage is
  lost the DID can never be updated again by anyone, permanently, and every
  integration pinned to it is stranded. Credentials can be re-issued, an
  append-only identity log cannot. Internal keys remain fine as a signing
  verificationMethod inside a published document, where loss costs the ability to
  produce new signatures rather than control of the identity.

  The export refusal is not a permission check — admin is not a bypass, because
  the value of the origin is that no caller holds this power. There are two
  refusals (an early return and an in-match arm); removing either leaves the other,
  and removing both does not compile, since the match over KeyOrigin becomes
  non-exhaustive. An export path cannot silently reopen.

  Operator surfaces carry the cost prominently: `pnm keys create --internal`
  prints what is lost and requires the operator to type a confirmation phrase
  rather than mash y, the response repeats the warning, and docs/02-vta/
  internal-keys.md covers when to use one, what actually protects it (enclave
  measurement + KMS, not a mnemonic), and the two things that genuinely destroy
  it.



## [0.1.3](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.1.2...vta-keyspaces-v0.1.3) — 2026-08-16


## [0.1.2](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-keyspaces-v0.1.1...vta-keyspaces-v0.1.2) — 2026-08-13


### Added

- **release**: Publish vta-service and its closure again ([#962](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/962))

* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
