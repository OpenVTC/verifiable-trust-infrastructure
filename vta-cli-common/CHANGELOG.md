## [0.10.31](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-cli-common-v0.10.30...vta-cli-common-v0.10.31) — 2026-08-14


### Fixed

- **cli**: Make `dids list` show the DID, and plan errors say what failed ([#967](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/967))

Two unrelated fixes to the same delegated-update path, found chasing a
  `webvh/dids/update` that failed after its consent gate passed.

  **`pnm dids list` rendered a wide name beside an unreadable DID.** A
  ratatui `Table` lays out exactly as many columns as it has width
  constraints — a widths list shorter than the row is not padded, it
  truncates. `dids list` builds its header and its rows with a conditional
  Name column but built the widths without one, so every width landed a
  column to the left: Name inherited the DID's flexing `Min`, the DID
  inherited Context's fixed 16 (`did:webvh:Qm0M8Cr`, cut mid-SCID) and
  `Created` fell off the right-hand end. The servers table above it had the
  same shape of bug from the other direction — its widths were written
  against a different column order, and their own comments still said so.

  Header and widths are now returned together from `did_list_columns`, so
  the two cannot drift, and the DID column starts at 46 columns: `shorten_did`
  abbreviates only the SCID and keeps host and path in full, which is what
  makes the value copyable.

  **Every webvh dry-run failure became `internalError`.** The planner runs
  on the consent path and only there, so that flattening applied to exactly
  the report an approver-gated update produces: a DID the VTA does not hold,
  a context the requester cannot act in, and a genuine signing bug all
  arrived as one opaque internal error — while the *ungated* execution of
  the very same task answered `taskFailed: did not found: …`. Turning
  consent on made the diagnosis worse than leaving it off.

  Dry-run failures now route through the existing
  `From<UpdateDidWebvhError> for AppError`, so plan and execute answer with
  the same variant for the same cause, with `webvh update dry-run:` framing
  the message. The Forbidden-collapses-to-NotFound rule that stops a
  dry-run being used to probe for DIDs in unseen contexts is preserved, and
  pinned by a test.



## [0.10.30](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-cli-common-v0.10.29...vta-cli-common-v0.10.30) — 2026-08-12


### Added

- **did-webvh**: Let a minted DID advertise TSP at the VTA's mediator ([#959](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/959))

A VTA-minted DID could never advertise TSP, whatever the VTA's own config
  said. `add_mediator_service` publishes the VTA's mediator as a
  `DIDCommMessaging` service and nothing else, so a caller wanting `#tsp`
  had to hand-build the service entry and pass it through
  `additional_services` — which means knowing the mediator DID, the one
  thing `add_mediator_service` exists so a caller does not have to know.
  Nobody did, so every persona-shaped identity is DIDComm-only by
  construction, and the both-ends transport rule can never resolve to TSP
  for one. TSP could be enabled end to end and the intersection would still
  be DIDComm.

  Surfaced by OpenVTC #211, where a join failed at the mediator and the
  applicant persona's document turned out to carry exactly one service
  entry.

  Adds `add_tsp_service` to the create-DID wire, honoured by
  `with_tsp_service` in `did_webvh/document.rs`. The entry points at the
  same mediator the DIDComm entry names — TSP advertises a mediator DID,
  not a transport URL (D8) — using the fragment and type the setup path and
  the runtime `services tsp enable` patcher already emit, so a document
  minted here, minted at setup, or patched later are the same shape.

  Two gates, neither redundant. The caller's flag is opt-in and
  deliberately not implied by `add_mediator_service`: a DID advertising a
  transport its holder cannot decode is unreachable over that transport,
  and only the caller knows whether the client behind the DID reads TSP
  frames. Ours is `[services] tsp` plus a configured mediator: a VTA whose
  own stack does not run TSP must not mint documents claiming it does,
  which is the failure this prevents rather than spreads. A caller-supplied
  `TSPTransport` entry wins over the injected one — matched on the service
  `type`, never the `#id` fragment.

  Additive on the wire in both directions: `skip_serializing_if` on the
  request and `Option` on the body, so an unset field serialises exactly as
  before and a VTA that predates it ignores the key.



## [0.10.29](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/vta-cli-common-v0.10.28...vta-cli-common-v0.10.29) — 2026-08-12


### Fixed

- **vault**: Send entryId on vault release, from both the CLI and the MCP bridge ([#948](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/948))

* fix(vault): use entryId instead of id in vault release payload

  cmd_vault_release was constructing the vault/release/0.1 Trust Task
  payload with key `id`, which fails schema validation. The schema
  requires `entryId` (matching VaultReleaseBody's camelCase
  serialisation on the server side).
