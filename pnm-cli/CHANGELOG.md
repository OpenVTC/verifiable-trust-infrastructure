## [0.12.0](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/compare/pnm-cli-v0.11.22...pnm-cli-v0.12.0) — 2026-08-12


### Fixed

- **provisioning**: Relay the holder's bootstrap VP as raw JSON ([#949](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/949))

A relayer is usually not the holder — the air-gap onboarding flow exists
  precisely so it isn't — so `pnm bootstrap provision-integration` forwards
  a document some other process signed. It parsed that document into a
  typed `BootstrapRequest` and let serde re-render it on the way out, so
  the maintainer verified bytes the holder never signed. Both transports,
  every relayed request.

  Same defect as #946 one layer up, and with the same trigger: #917 moved
  `ask.type` to the 0.2 camelCase tag, so a holder on vta-sdk < 0.21.11
  (did-hosting `VTI-Cypress-RC-1` among them) has its own valid signature
  rewritten in transit and rejected as a forgery at the far end. #946 fixed
  the two maintainer-side surfaces that re-serialised; this is the client
  side of the same rule, and the two together close the flow.

  `ProvisionIntegrationRequest.request` and `provision_integration_didcomm`
  now take `serde_json::Value`. **Breaking** for anything constructing that
  struct. Callers that signed the VP themselves — every SDK runner — go
  through the new `BootstrapRequest::to_signed_wire_value`, where serde
  output and signed bytes are the same document by construction; pnm keeps
  a typed view purely to read `contextHint` and relays the raw JSON.

  `provision_integration_didcomm`'s doc comment already promised the VP was
  "left byte-identical either way". It now is.

  The existing relay tests could not have caught this: they assert the body
  carries `serde_json::to_value(&vp)`, which is the SDK's rendering
  compared against itself and true however badly the relayer mangles a
  foreign document. The new test starts from a VP this crate did not
  render, relays it under both spec versions, and requires it to arrive
  byte-for-byte and still verify. It also asserts the fixture actually
  diverges from this crate's serde output, so it fails loudly rather than
  going quietly vacuous if the casings ever converge.
