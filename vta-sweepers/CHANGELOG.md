* feat(release): publish vta-service and its closure again

  #938 unpublished `vta-service` and the twelve subsystem crates behind it,
  on the finding that nothing external depended on them. The audit read
  normal dependencies. `openvtc-core` depends on `vta-service` as a
  **dev-dependency**, for `test_support::MockVta` — an in-process VTA its
  end-to-end tests run against. That harness boots the real service, so no
  client crate can stand in for it.

  Unpublishing did not merely freeze the crate. It broke it.

  `vti-common` re-exports `vta_sdk::acl::{ActScope, ApproveScope,
  ContextDirection}` as its own public API, so **a re-export makes the
  re-exported crate's version part of your public API**: any graph
  combining `vti-common` with another `vta-sdk` consumer must resolve one
  `vta-sdk`. The frozen `vta-service` 0.14.37 asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21`
  while `vti-common` has moved to `^0.23`. A downstream `cargo update`
  resolves both and `vta-service` fails to compile with

    expected `vti_common::acl::ApproveScope`,
       found `vta_sdk::acl::ApproveScope`

  at ten call sites — which is how this surfaced, in openvtc #213. Nothing
  downstream can fix that; only a release that moves the requirements
  together can.

  So the thirteen manifests go back to the workspace default. The cost is
  the closure — twelve subsystem crates return to crates.io, which is
  exactly what #938 set out to stop. Taken deliberately over the
  alternatives: yanking the published copies breaks OpenVTC's tests with no
  replacement, and leaving them up ships a crate on the registry that
  cannot be built.

  **On release ordering.** `cargo publish --dry-run -p vta-service` fails
  today, and will until the closure is on the registry: packaging strips
  path deps, so `vta-keys = "0.2"` resolves the *published* 0.2.1, which
  still asks for `vta-sdk ^0.21` — two nodes, same error. That resolves
  itself in the release, which publishes in dependency order: every
  subsystem crate in this workspace already requires `vta-sdk = "0.23"`, so
  once they upload, `vta-service` verifies against them. Crates whose
  dependencies are all published already dry-run clean (verified on
  `vta-keyspaces` and `vta-config`).

  Docs updated to match: CLAUDE.md, RELEASING.md and the release-plz.toml
  header all said 7-of-21. They now say 20-of-26, name the six that stay
  internal, and record the rule the audit missed — check dev-dependencies,
  in sibling repos, before unpublishing anything.



### Build & CI

- **release**: Adopt release-plz, publish 7 crates instead of 21 ([#938](https://github.com/OpenVTC/verifiable-trust-infrastructure/pull/938))

Merging and releasing were the same act. publish.yml fired on every push to
  main and shipped whatever versions were newly present, and a CI guard required
  the version bump to live in the feature PR — so every PR was a release
  decision, taken by whoever opened it, days before it merged. Two open PRs
  touching one crate wrote the same number into the same line of the same
  Cargo.toml, and the second to merge had to rebase, renumber, and fix a
  changelog entry that had gone stale. #932/#936/#937 hit it three times in one
  afternoon.
